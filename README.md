# Python Game with Pygame

Welcome to my game project developed in [Python](https://www.python.org/), using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) and [Pytmx](https://pytmx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) libraries.
This game is inspired by Pok√©mon, where players can defeat opponents, face bosses, explore the world, and evolve your's monsters!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Pygame
- Pytmx

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame pytmx

```

## Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GustavoAnjos2005/monster-collection

```
### Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repository
```

### Run the Game

To start the game, you can run it in an interactive window locally, or play the pre-compiled executable version available in the "code" directory.

## Create an Executable

If you would like to create an executable and encounter any issues with the generated file, follow these instructions:
- Install PyInstaller (if you haven't already):

```bash
pip install pyinstaller

```

- Navigate to your game directory and run the following command:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile your_game.py

```

This will create an executable in the dist folder. You need to move the executable to the game directory to run it.
